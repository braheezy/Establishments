#Establishments 

(Verse 1)
My pockets full of virtues 
Ive been living off of verses
Packing backpacks with my fears 
And then flying across oceans
Must I leave this place I love so much
Politicians that I cannot trust
All just runnamuk looking for a rich donor just to fund them up
Spending a few more dollars now you got a few more delgetaes
Fucking up our system but they don’t claim to be celibebte 
Speaking truthfully the test is that
They sold their soul, funded by the one percent 


(Chorus?)

They said we're who the represent,

But I don't really care no more I don't reall care no more,

Drop that ballot in the bin,

But I don't really care no more I don't really care no more,

I think my voting is a sin,

So I don't really care no more I don't really care no more,

Does it matter in the end?

Cause I don't really care no more, I don't really care no more

(Verse 2)
Spending money from the people 
Getting rich is what they represent 
All this starts to make some sense
Our government is fullshit
Taking money from the people 
Giving back to the establishment 
Establishing establishments 
I don’t think that we having it
We came here for our freedom
So best believe we getting that again
I never promised loyalty to those I wouldn’t fight for them 
So why we still believe that we’d be safe from the establishment (establishment)
Thinking of the places that we could live in peace (yea I know) 
Wanna be free and wanna live happily with glee  (yea I know)
Know that the pursuit of happiness is an inalienable right 
One that was given to me without the need for fight
