Establishments 
My pockets full of virtues 
Ive been living off of verses
Packing backpacks with my fears 
And then flying across oceans
Must I leave this place I love so much
Politicians that a can it trust 
All just runnamuk looking for a rich donor just to fund them up
Spending a few more dollars now you got a few more delgetaes
Fucking up our system but they don’t claim to be celibebte 
Speaking truthfully the test is that
They sold their so funded by the one percent 
Spending money from the people 
Getting rich is what the represent 
All this starts to make some sense
Our government is fullshit
Taking money from the people 
Giving back to the establishment 
Establishing establishments 
I don’t think that we having it
We came here for our freedom
So best believe we getting that again
I never promised loyalty to those I wouldn’t fight for them 
So why we still believe the we’lol be safe from the establishment establishment
Thinking of the places that we could live in peace I know I 
Wanna be free and wanna live happily Yes I know
Know that the pursuit of happiness is an inalienable right 
One that was given to me without the need for fight
