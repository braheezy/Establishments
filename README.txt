#Establishments 

(Verse 1)
yea
My pockets full of virtues (really need to pronounce this clearly cause it sounds like you say 'verses')
Ive been living off of these verses
Packing backpacks with my fears 
As I rocket across oceans
Must I leave this place I love so much
Politicians that I cannot trust
All just run amok looking for rich donors to fund them up
Claim to be one of us as they cover up lust
Fucking our system after they say they are celibate
Spend a few more dollars now they get a few more delegates
Fuck a debt limit while the poor live in squalor
They sold their soul and honor, who do they really represent?

(Chorus?)
But I don't think they care for y'all (x2)
(These bits after the repeated line should be said in double time)
Drop that ballot in the bin
Just so that they win (or, just to get a pin?)

But I don't think they care for y'all (x2)
I think my voting is a sin
It's all dust in the wind

But I don't think they care for y'all (x2)
Does the fight begin?
Does it even matter in the end?

Cause I don't really care no more, I don't really care no more

(Verse 2)
(Digging into this. I love the ensuing rhymes off "represent". I see the 
connection between the "Spending money" and "Taking money" lines, so I 
didn't want to touch those.)

Spending money from the people 
Getting rich is what they represent 
All this starts to make some sense
Our government is full of shit
Taking money from the people 
Giving back to the establishment


Just so they can establish what?
(I think the "A land of lavish" line works great for rhymes and imagery,
Struggled on how to finish the line cause flow feels off...gave a couple of examples,)
A land of lavish with no enrichment (Maybe you can force the rhyme btwn "what" and "enrichment" or "deficient" based on pronounciation?)
A land of lavish so deficient
(Hard to describe but I'm thinking a 'break' in flow. At this point in the song, you've been going steady. Here, you do short lines with pauses to fill up the measure. Delivery would be key. Then one long bar, then back to the steady flow for the end of the song.)
Insufficient
Inefficient
Inconsistent
And with malignant intent, they steal our nourishment (probably need to pad this line more to fit 2 measures)


I don’t think that we having it (x2)
We came here for our freedom
So best believe we getting that again
I never promised loyalty to those I wouldn’t fight for them 
why would I believe that we’d be safe from the establishment (establishment)
Thinking of the places that we could leave, we wasn't having it
Thinking of the places that we could live in peace (yea I know) 
Wanna be free and wanna live happily with glee  (yea I know)
Know that the pursuit of happiness is an inalienable right 
One that was given to me without the need for fight

But i been fighting all my life so im a keep it real tight
